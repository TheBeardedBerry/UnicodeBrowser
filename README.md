# How to Use

Open Window via `Window -> Unicode Browser`

## Features

* Displays a grid of all characters mapped to a named Unicode Block. (See [UnicodeBlockRange.inl](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/585df42eb3a391efd295abd231333df20cddbcf3/Engine/Source/Runtime/SlateCore/Public/Fonts/UnicodeBlockRange.inl) in Editor Source.).
* Filter displayed characters by Block.
* Lists all named Unicode Blocks that have mapped characters.
* Shows zoomed-in view of the character, and additional information when hovering over it.
* Character information: measurements, scaling, subfont index, fallback font used, if any.
* Ability to filter blocks to "only symbols"; preselects Blocks known to have useful, supported symbols e.g. Arrows, Box Drawing, Emoji.
* Ability to change font.
* Show/hide missing characters
* **Double-click a character to copy it to the system clipboard**.
* Click a block name to scroll to that block.
* Zoom: Change font size with CTRL + MouseWheel, change column count with CTRL + SHIFT + MouseWheel
* Search: Search in Tags defined in a preset or by characters/letters, supports multiple search terms at once, e.g.: a,b,c,d

> [!WARNING]
> **Disclaimer:** Plugin is currently in its infancy and as such leaves much to be desired regarding the user-experience, but it's usable, and useful!

## Supported Engine Version

The plugin was developed for Unreal Engine 5.5.1+, though it should work for all 5.x versions.

## Installation

The best way is to clone this repository as a submodule; that way you can contribute
pull requests and more importantly, easily get latest updates.
 
The project should be placed in your project's `Plugins` folder.

```bash
cd YourProject

git commit -m "Added UnicodeBrowser Plugin as a submodule."
```

Alternatively you can download a ZIP of this repo and place it in `YourProject/Plugins/`.

## TODO & Known Issues

* Figure out how to successfully read character names from the icu db e.g. âš” -> "Crossed Swords". Currently calling [u_charname](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/f8aa68b0c1c9584633e7a61157185f1a2c275f58/icu4c/source/common/unames.cpp#L1450) gives me a `u_file_access_error`. Names would be particularly useful for characters which don't display correctly. 
* Use the character names as a starting point to getting useful search e.g. [see this example](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/search?q=cross#characters)
* Block search & filtering (e.g. hide unchecked languages by default)
* Persist window state
* Settings page for adding new presets
* Your suggestions?
